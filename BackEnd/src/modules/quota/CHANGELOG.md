## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Eliminated TOCTOU race condition in `enforceQuestCreationQuota` and `enforcePayoutQuota`. The separate check and increment operations are now wrapped in a database transaction with a `SELECT FOR UPDATE` (pessimistic write) row lock, ensuring concurrent requests cannot both pass the quota check before either increments the counter.
